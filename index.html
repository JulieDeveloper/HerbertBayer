          Considering the historical context, Germany's loss in World War I, and
          the rapid advancements in mass printing technology, Bayer was
          dissatisfied with the decorated designs of the 1800s and refused to
          continue the old-fashioned style.

          He advocated for transforming the form of visual language to match how
          people naturally speak. In 1925, he successfully persuaded the Bauhaus
          leadership to stop using capital letters in the school’s official
          publications and communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          This decision was made considering the efficiency and functionality of
          the typeface. Bayer believed that since spoken words don't include
          uppercase and it’s quicker to write in German, there should be no need
          for it in written language.

        </div>
        <p>
          To demonstrate his idea, Bayer developed a new typography, the
          "Universal Alphabet", which is characterized by geometric shapes,
          lowercase letters, and systematic grids. This concept successfully
          resolved the problems of visual design by combining art and
          technology. It significantly influenced the development of typography
          and advertising in Bauhaus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evolution of the Universal type demonstrated a shift from
          nineteenth-century cultural values to an industrial world, where every
          sector is seeking the best efficiency. This embodies the importance of
          Bayer's ideas in simplicity and functional design to address societal
          problems within typography.

          In 1925, Bayer designed an experimental typeface named “Universal
          Alphabet”, which also known as “Universal Typeface”.
        </p>

        <p>
          He aimed to create designs that were timeless instead of trendy by
          removing personal style or self-expression from his work. also known
          as the "Universal Typeface."
        </p>
        <p>
          This method led Bayer to try to create a typeface with such "basic"
          letters that would be universally understood by society. By removing
          the uppercase letter, it would be easier and quicker to write in
          German. Since most type was produced by machines, Bayer thought it was
          unnecessary to consider the usage of the chisel. He replaced the touch
          of the hand with the consistent style of this "rationalized" typeface.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper text">

        </div>
        <p>
          By utilizing a single-case alphabet, which would be easier for
          children to learn, the lack of uppercase letters would reduce the
          printer's storage space, setup time, and overall costs. The typeface
          was designed with machine print and typewriters in mind, further
          emphasizing its functional aspect while producing efficient results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite its innovative design, the font was not widely used and has
          been transformed into print. However, it was not meant to be a
          finalized typeface, but rather a conceptual experiment in developing a
          visual identity in the alphabet. It played a crucial role in
          establishing Bayer as a pioneer in functional typography and set the
          stage for future developments in the field.

          In the 1930s, Bayer participated in various exhibitions, including the
          Werkbund Exhibition in Paris, 1930, and "Das Wunder des Lebens" in
          Berlin, 1934. face”.

        <p>
          The above poster is one of the famous graphic designs created by
          Herbert Bayer in 1930. The content suggests that it's an advertisement
          for an exhibition about the Society of Artists and Decorators in
          Paris.
        </p>
        <p>
          Analyzing the composition design of the graphic, it's clear that a
          strong sense of hierarchy is established through the layout structure,
          font size, and imagery. The layout structure follows a clear grid
          system, which is very common in modernist design. This grid system
          helps organize the elements and creates visual order.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main title is placed at the top, immediately drawing the viewer's
          attention, followed by the image and the footer text at the bottom.
          This vertical arrangement guides the reader's eye from top to bottom,
          effectively communicating the information in a logical sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design cleverly uses different font sizes to create a hierarchy of
          information. The title, "allemende", being the most important element,
          is set in the largest font size. It is followed by the subtitle, set
          in a smaller font size, which is used for the text "section" and
          "exposition", and finally, the bottom captions, set in the smallest
          font size. This gradation in font sizes helps distinguish between the
          primary, secondary, and tertiary information in the design.
        </p>
        <p>
          The imagery, which occupies a significant portion of the design,
          provides a visual representation of the text content. It is placed at
          the center, balancing the weight of the text above and below. The use
          of black and white for the graphic shapes also creates a strong
          contrast with the heading, further emphasizing its importance in the
          design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, Herbert Bayer's principle in the Universal Alphabet is
          used throughout the design. This typeface, characterized by its
          geometric simplicity and lowercase-only principle, gives the design a
          modern and simple look.</br>
          The letterform construction is different from Bayer’s initial design
          of the Universal Alphabet in 1925. The typeface in the poster appears
          more narrowed, as you can see in the counter space of the “o”, which
          has a vertical stress. Also, the apertures, which can be seen in the
          “a”, “e”, “s”, “g” appear more as a square instead of a circular
          negative space. The typeface is not constructed by a uniform width.
          However, it is still a great example for seeing it being used in a
          composition design, as Bayer’s initial designs were never produced.

        </div>
        <p>
          Bayer intended to base his designs on Western letterforms instead of
          creating a new typeface. When he designed the alphabet "a", he
          outlined the historical progression of the letter "a", which shows his
          design referred to the Greek's creation

        <!-- q -->

          <img src="assets/q.png" alt="Universal Alphabet Letter 'q'" />
        </div>
        <p>
          In the Universal Alphabet, letters with a descender portion, including
          “g”, “j”, “p”, “q”, and “y”, utilize a short straight line for the
          part below the baseline. The letters “g” and “q” share the same
          structure, making them appear similar.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, they differ by opening up at the top right corner of the
          bowl. The letter “o” exemplifies the typeface's geometric basis,
          appearing as a perfect circle in both the counter space and stroke
          without any uneven stress. Also, the letters “b”, “d”, “p”, and “q”
          incorporate a circular bowl and perfect circles as the counters,
          attached to a vertical straight stroke. Also, the letters "c" and "e"
          share a similar design in their finials, both finishing with the same
          angle at the end of the apertures.
        </p>
        <!-- m -->
        <div class="img-wrapper m">
          <img src="assets/m.png" alt="Universal Alphabet Letter 'm'" />
        </div>
        <p>
          The letters "m", "n", "w", and "u" feature a perfect half-circle in
          their shoulder, arc, and vertex, each connected by two straight
          strokes. The character “v” is formed by two strokes meeting at the
          bottom, creating a sharply angled crotch. However, its vertex suggests
          a half-circular outline. This design helps prevent confusion between
          the letters “v” and “u”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bayer removed all unnecessary decoration in the letterform to maintain
          a clean look. For example, in the letter “f”, he removed the left side
          of its crossbar, ensuring the width of the crossbar matches almost the
          same width as its hook. In addition, The Universal Alphabet also
          showcases unique features. The letter “x” is designed with two
          half-arched strokes. It is special because it has a different writing
          sequence than the Roman letter "x". Also, the letter “k” is displayed
          as a small cap due to the absence of the usual ascender portion.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, the typeface is designed with a strategy in mind. It is a
          combination of multiple reusable components, which ensures a clean and
          consistent look by displaying similar parts across the typeface.
          Despite his intention to design based on Western letterforms, he
          introduced a new writing sequence in the language. The Universal
          Alphabet was created without the Roman styling like the serif feature
          and calligraphic pen trace, it appeared as a simplified, geometric
          typeface that revolutionized the field of typography.

          The influence of the Universal Alphabet is evident in various design
          contexts. It is primarily used in large-scale headings and branding
          logos. Brands like Beats Music, Labello, Dyson, ABC, Pepsi (2014),
          IHOP, and Pizza Pizza have all incorporated features of the Universal
          Alphabet into their branding logos.

        <p>
          It's easy to notice that these logos are constructed with perfect
          circles, such as the letters "b", "d", "p", which consist of a circle
          at the counter and are attached to a straight stem. Just like the
          Universal Alphabet, all logos share a universal width.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although a few of them mix uppercase letters and some letterforms have
          been altered for branding purposes, it's still noticeable that they
          reflect the enduring influence of Bayer's revolutionary design.

        <p>
          As the meaning of the typeface changes in different contexts and they
          are redesigned differently to fit the cultural trend, Bayer’s initial

          and Scandinavia in the 1930s.

          Besides Universal Alphabet and Bayer-Type, Herbert Bayer also designed
          a unique script without outlines when he was working in Bauhaus.
        </p>
        <p>
          This script was meant to grab attention in posters and brochures. The
          aim of this new typeface was to remove national characteristic
          features in typography. This made international communication easier
          and more effective.
